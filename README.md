# Spaceship Titanic Passenger Data Analysis

## Overview
Welcome to the Spaceship Titanic Passenger Data Analysis project! This repository contains data and analysis on passengers aboard the Spaceship Titanic. The dataset includes personal records of about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, which will be used as training data for predictive modeling.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **PassengerId**: A unique ID for each passenger, including group information and individual number.
- **HomePlanet**: The planet the passenger departed from, typically their planet of permanent residence.
- **CryoSleep**: Indicates whether the passenger elected to be put into suspended animation for the duration of the voyage.
- **Cabin**: The cabin number where the passenger is staying, including deck, number, and side.
- **Destination**: The planet the passenger will be debarking to.
- **Age**: The age of the passenger.
- **VIP**: Whether the passenger has paid for special VIP service during the voyage.
- **RoomService**, **FoodCourt**, **ShoppingMall**, **Spa**, **VRDeck**: Amount billed at each of the luxury amenities aboard Spaceship Titanic.
- **Name**: The first and last names of the passenger.
- **Transported**: The target variable indicating whether the passenger was transported to another dimension.

## Project Goals
The main objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Explore and analyze the Spaceship Titanic passenger data.
2. Develop predictive models to predict whether a passenger will be transported to another dimension.
3. Provide insights and recommendations based on the analysis.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vishnu55510/spaceship-titanic-passenger-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd spaceship-titanic-passenger-analysis
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook (`spaceship_titanic_passenger_analysis.ipynb`) to view the analysis and modeling process.
